This is a Comic Fansite made using Javascript, Handlebars, Express, and a ton of other dependencies. 

The purpose of this site is to test my abilities with Javascript, specificially my back end capabilties with Node.js. I also made this site to test my SQL skills, and to become more familiar with the browser compatability area of web development. 

The site currently sits at https://whispering-ravine-45227.herokuapp.com.

Edit:

I've dropped a large portion of the database due to AWS charging me money. For this reason you won't be able to login, I will probably just make it auto login at some point.
